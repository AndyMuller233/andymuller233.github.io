		<h2>Our Projects and Initiatives</h2>
		
		<h4>Clean Our Beach Campaign:</h4>
        <p>We organise regular beach clean-up events where volunteers come together to collect and properly dispose of litter along the coastline.</br> You can check out the photos and stories of our clean-up efforts and the positive impact it has on the marine ecosystem.</p>
		
		<h4>Plant a Tree, Save a Life Initiative:</h4>
        <p>We have launched a tree-planting campaign to combat deforestation and promote biodiversity.</br> We provide information on the types of trees we are planting, their benefits, and how individuals can get involved in our tree-planting activities.</p>
		
		<h4>Community Gardens:</h4>
		<p>We have established community gardens in urban areas to promote local food production and green spaces.</br> We highlight the benefits of community gardens, such as fostering community connections, providing access to fresh produce, and improving food security.</p>
